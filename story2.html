Melinda Coleman, right, moved away from Maryville, Mo., after her daughter, Daisy, the accuser in a rape case, was harassed.

<p>Ms. Coleman said she was harassed at school and on Facebook and Twitter. In one instance, she said, she was walking to the bathroom at school when a boy popped into the hallway and yelled "Liar!" at her.</p>
<p>"We had a handful of people that were really good to us, and we had a handful of people that just completely stayed out of it," Ms. Coleman said. "But then we had a large group of people that were not so kind towards us."
</p>
<p>Her mother chimed in: 
<blockquote>"I would say it was pretty split. The people that were against us were so aggressively against us and so verbal and so hateful."</blockquote>
<p>Unable to withstand the harassment, the Colemans, who had moved to Maryville after the death of Ms. Coleman's father, returned to their hometown, Albany, about 30 miles away.</p>
<p>Their house in Maryville burned down after they left, and the cause remains unknown.</p>
<p>Mr. Rice, who declined to be interviewed, dismissed the charges months after they were filed, saying Ms. Coleman and her mother had stopped cooperating, something they both denied.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barnett's lawyer, Robert Sundell, also declined to be interviewed but released a statement accusing Ms. Coleman of inconsistent testimony at a deposition and changing her story several times. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Coleman says she never changed her account of what happened that night, and Sheriff Darren White agrees.</p>
<p>"I think that they have been fairly consistent with that portion of it," he said.</p> 
<p>But Sheriff White, who said he believed that Ms. Coleman had been sexually assaulted, also blamed the dropping of the case on her lack of cooperation.</p>
<p>Adam Clark, 32, who has lived here for about a decade, said he and a friend drove to a town about 45 minutes away on a recent evening to see a movie, to "kind of get breathing space from all the activity, the negativity."</p>
<p>He said he had not taken a side in the case and welcomed a re-examination.</p>
<p>"One thing about us here," he said, "if there's a problem, we'll fix it."</p>
